Context (to link new chat to previous one)

We are continuing development of the Singapore Labour Intelligence Dashboard built in Python (Gradio + Plotly). The base version includes:

Composite Talent Shortage Index (0–100)

4-panel dashboard (Demand vs TSI, Postings by Salary Band, Median Salary Trend, Vacancy Heatmap)

Cached aggregation

Singapore job-market dataset

Your goal - Tell me which direction you want next (choose one or combine):

A — Intelligence Layer
Labour market tightness index (macro)
Wage pressure index
Supply–demand imbalance score
Sector risk / overheating signals
Executive narrative engine

B — Analytics Upgrade
Time-series forecasting (Prophet / ARIMA)
Demand trend detection
Structural shortage detection
Salary band migration analysis

C — Dashboard UX Upgrade
Filters + instant recompute
Drill-down by sector → salary → role
KPI header cards
Executive summary auto-generated

D — Performance & Scale
Polars / DuckDB engine
Million-row optimization
Lazy aggregation
Incremental refresh

E — Policy / Singapore Labour Lens
MOM-style tightness index
Workforce transformation signals
Skills gap detection
Local vs foreign workforce proxy


When you open the new chat

Tell me:
Which enhancement track(s) you want (A–E)
Whether dataset will remain the same or expand
Whether this dashboard is for analysis / executive / public / strategy
Then I will design the next architecture step and begin building.

I’ll be ready when you open the new branch.
